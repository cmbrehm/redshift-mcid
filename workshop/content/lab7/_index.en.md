In this lab, we step through some common operations a Redshift Administrator may have to do to maintain their Redhshift environment.

## Before You Begin
This lab assumes you have launched a Redshift cluster.  If you have not launched a cluster, see [LAB 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters](../lab1.html).

## Event Subscriptions
1. Navigate to your Redshift Events page.  Notice the *Events* involved with creating the cluster.  
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/home?#events
```

2. Click on the *Event subscriptions* tab and then click on the *Create event subscription* button.

3. Create a subscription named *ClusterManagement* with the Source type *Cluster* for *all clusters* and a severity of *Info, Error*.

4. Choose the subscription actions.  Choose *Create a new SNS topic* and name that topic *ClusterManagement*. Click *Create Topic*.

5. Ensure the subscription is enabled, and click on *Create event subscription*.â€º

6. Navigate to the SNS console and click on the newly created topic *ClusterManagement*.  Click on *Create subscription*.
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home?#/topics
```

7. Enter the protocol *Email* and enter the endpoint of an email address you have access to. Click *Create subscription*.

8. You will recieve an email shortly.  Click on the *Confirm subscription* link in the email.

9. The link should take you to a final confirmation page confirming the subscription.

## Cluster Encryption
Note: This portion of the lab will take ~45 minutes to complete based on the data loaded in [LAB 2 - Creating Redshift Clusters](../lab2.html).  Please plan accordingly.

1. Navigate to your Redshift Cluster list.  Select your cluster and click on *Actions* -> *Modify*.
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/home?#clusters
```
![](../images/ModifyCluster.png)

2. Under *Database configurations*, enable the *Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)* radio option.  Click *Modify cluster*.
![](../images/EnableKMS.png)

4. Notice your cluster enters a *resizing* status.  The process of encrypting your cluster is similar to resizing your cluster using the classic resize method.  All data is read, encrypted and re-written. During this time, the cluster is still available for read queries, but not write queries.

5. You should also receive an email notification about the cluster resize because of the event subscription we setup earlier.

## Cross Region Snapshots
1. Navigate to your Redshift Cluster list.  Select your cluster and click on *Actinos* -> *Configure Cross-region snapshots*.
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/home?#clusters
```
![](../images/ConfigureCRR_0.png)

2. Select the *Yes* radio button to enable the copy.  Select the destination region of *us-east-2*.  Because the cluster is encrypted you must establish a grant in the other region to allow the snapshot to be re-encrypted.  Select *Create new grant* for the Choose a Snapshot Copy Grant.  Name the Snapshot Copy Grant with the value *snapshotgrant*.  Click *Save*.

3. To demonstrate the cross-region replication, initiate a manual backup.  Click on *Actions* -> *Create snapshot*.
![](../images/Snapshot_0.png)

4. Name the snapshot *CRRBackup* and click *Create snapshot*.
![](../images/Snapshot_1.png)

5. Navigate to your list of snapshots and notice the snapshot is being created.
```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/home?#snapshots
```
![](../images/Snapshot_2.png)

6. Wait for the snapshot to finish being created.  The status will be *Available*.
![](../images/Snapshot_3.png)

7. Navigate to the us-east-2 region by select *Ohio* from the region drop down, or navigate to the following link.  
```
https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/redshiftv2/home?region=us-east-2#snapshots
```

## Elastic Resize
Note: This portion of the lab will take ~15 minutes to complete, please plan accordingly.
1. Navigate to your Redshift Cluster list.  Select your cluster and click on *Actions* -> *Resize*.  Note, if you don't see your cluster, you may have to change the *Region* drop-down.
![](../images/Resize_0.png)

2. Ensure the *Elastic Resize* radio is selected.  Choose the *New number of nodes*, and click *Resize now*.
![](../images/Resize_1.png)

3. When the resize operation begins, you'll see the Cluster Status of *Preparing for resize*.
![](../images/Resize_2.png)

4. When the operation completes, you'll see the Cluster Status of *Available* again.

## Before You Leave
If you are done using your cluster, please think about decommissioning it to avoid having to pay for unused resources.
