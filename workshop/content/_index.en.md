Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse solution that uses columnar storage to minimise IO, provides high data compression rates, and offers fast performance. This set of workshops provides a series of exercises which help users get started using the Redshift platform. It also helps demonstrate the many features built into the platform.
